TODO

- Code : move code from friture.py to widget-specific class, for time and frequency plots
- Code : continue profiling (why replot() calls are so long ?, try to profile acquisition and profiling threads)
- Code/GUI : allow to choose input channel from a list of available channels, with description
- Code : comments in the code
- Code/GUI : new widget for long run level measurements
- Code : add option for overlapping fft windows for smoother spectrograms
- GUI : option (checkbox ?, list ?) to enable widgets
