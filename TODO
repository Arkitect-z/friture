TODO

Improvements :
- Code : continue profiling (why do python and Xorg take so much CPU while profiling shows that most of the time is pent being idle ?)
- Code : comments in the code
- Code/Maths : constant-Q-transform for efficient and precise logarithmic spectrogram

Features :
- Code/GUI : pointer and markers for the plots
- GUI : option (checkbox ?, list ?) to enable widgets
- Code : overlapping fft windows for smoother spectrograms
- Code/GUI : new widget for long run level measurements

Bugfixes :
- code : unwanted delay between input and display
