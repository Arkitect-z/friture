TODO

Improvements :
- Code : continue profiling (why do python and Xorg take so much CPU while profiling shows that most of the time is pent being idle ?)
- Code : comments in the code
- Code/Maths : constant-Q-transform for efficient and precise logarithmic spectrogram

Features :
- GUI : option (checkbox ?, list ?) to enable widgets
- Code : overlapping fft windows for smoother spectrograms
- Code/GUI : new widget for long run level measurements

Bugfixes :
- code : unwanted delay between input and display
	Seems related to pulseaudio:

- code : when there is no input, audio data goes to 0., and log spectrum goes to -Inf,
 which seems to slow down computations enormously.
- code : the device info from portaudio reports a low input latency (max 46 ms), but after opening the stream, it is reported to be 139 ms. Why ?
