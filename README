Friture (french word for "frying", also used for "noise" in a sound) is a simple application to draw real-time spectrogram of live audio data.

It can be useful for educational purposes, to analyze and tweak the audio response of a hall, etc.

See http://wiki.github.com/tlecomte/friture for screenshots and more information.
