Friture
=======

**Friture** is an application to draw real-time visualisations of live audio data, such as level meter, scope, spectrum or spectrogram.

It can be useful for educational purposes, or to analyze the audio response of a hall, etc.

"Friture" is a french word for "frying", also used for "noise" in a sound.
